#         By default, Spring Cloud Config will do all the property decryption on the server and
#         pass the results back to the applications consuming the properties as plain, unencrypted text.
#         However, you can tell Spring Cloud Config to not decrypt on the server
#         and make it the responsibility of the application retrieving the configuration data to
#         decrypt the encrypted properties.
